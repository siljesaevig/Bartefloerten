    <h2>4. Navigation Structure</h2>
    <p>We have decided to use Hierarchical structures in our website. Because our website is not complex, the website also implements a navigation bar and all pages are linked from every pages to every pages. This is suited with the descriptions of the hierarchical structure.</p>
    <img src="img/structure.jpg" type="img/jpg">
    <p> From the figure, we have Homepage that contains the main navigation bar and one of the element in the main navigation bar which is Tips. Tips contains five sub-pages which is a drop down menu. This means that a user can travel across all pages back and forth, in other word all the pages are linked.</p>

    <h2>6. Content</h2>
    <p>There will be nine separate pages as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> <p> Homepage - home.html</p>
          <p>The homepage will be the first page you encounter when you visit the website. It will, as all the other pages, include the navigation bar for easy navigation to the rest of the pages. It will also include an image carousel with images and titles representing and linking to some of the pages to intrigue the reader. In the footer there will a small text explaining the goal of the website. </p>
          <p>The purpose of this page is only to be eye catching to the reader and peak their interest. This is why we are using big images and little text, in addition to our simple design. By using few and simple elements the navigation bar will stand out more to tempt the reader to further exploring the website. There will be no information except the goal to prevent overwhelming the reader, but give them an understanding of what they have encountered.</p>
          <p>The  image carousel will be implemented by using javascript and take up most of the page. Every image will represent one of the other pages and have its title incorporated into the image. By clicking the image or title you will be linked to the page in question. We want to use full size images for this page, but will consider changing the size and number of images depending on how much the loading time suffers.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Tips for her - her.html</p>
          <p>This page will provide dating tips for the ladies. The tips will be short texts or sentences in lists divided into suitable categories. Each category will be displayed in a simple box which will also contain an illustrating image. The boxes will be simple so they do not take away the reader's attention, but still sections up the content.</p>
          <p>To make this easy to navigate and stay simple to understand we will add some restrictions to the content:
          <ul>
            <li>The categories will appear in alphabetical order</li>
            <li>There will only be a manageable amount of categories, we see this as 6 or less </li>
            <li>A category will only have a manageable amount of tips, but not too few so it seems unnecessary. We see this as 8 to 12.</li>
          </ul>
         </p>
          <p>These restriction are based on an estimation of readability and suitability with the design and will be reevaluated as the content is added. 
          The image in the box will be the same size for every box so it matches our simple design. The specific size will be 300px * 300px and be placed in the top right corner of the box. This size is plenty to illustrate the category, but will not dray away the reader's attention.</p>
          <p>This page will also include a second navigation bar within the content. It will be in the same style as primary bar, but will contain the names of the categories. The bar will only contain internal links to the categories using tags. It will help the reader to get an overview of the content and navigate to the desired category fast. All the pages within the “Tips” section of the navigation bar will follow this design, with some adjustments to fit the different type of content.</p>
      </li>
      <li> <p>Tips for him - him.html </p>
            <p>This page will be equivalent to the “tips for her” page, but be directed to the gentlemen. It will contain the same design features and has the same type of content.</p>
